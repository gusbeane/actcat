% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Understanding the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy requires an understanding
of the orbital properties of stars, but the high dimensionality of phase space
makes this difficult. For this reason, many authors have explored the
possibility of using actions, which in principle reduce the six-dimensional
phase-space information into three dimensions, for many purposes in
understanding the Galaxy. We present a fully probabilistic action catalogue
for every star with a radial velocity in \textit{Gaia} DR2, as well as for
stars with radial velocities from the APOGEE, RAVE, . We present a separate
catalogue for each of these surveys.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by \citet{Others2013},
and describes the problem the authors aim to solve \citep[e.g.][]{Author2012}.

\section{Methods, Observations, Simulations etc.}

Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.
It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.

\subsection{Maths}
\label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
	\label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.

% Example figure
\begin{figure}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
\end{figure}

% Example table
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
	\label{tab:example_table}
	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
		\hline
		A & B & C & D\\
		\hline
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

The Acknowledgements section is not numbered. Here you can thank helpful
colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
Try to keep it short.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REFERENCES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

%\bibliographystyle{mnras}
%\bibliography{example} % if your bibtex file is called example.bib

\appendix

\section{Some extra material}

If you want to present additional material which would interrupt the flow of the main paper,
it can be placed in an Appendix which appears after the list of references.
